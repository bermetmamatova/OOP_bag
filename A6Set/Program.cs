/* BTA5BP Mamatova Bermet.
 * Task # 6
 * Implement the set type which contains integers. Represent the set as a sequence of its
elements. Implement as methods: inserting an element, removing an element, returning
whether the set is empty, returning whether the set contains an element, returning a
random element without removing it from the set, returning the number of even numbers
in the set (suggestion: store the number of even numbers and update it when the set
changes), printing the set. A set can store every element only once.
